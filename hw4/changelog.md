For the website changes (markup, style, content): 
    
    Updating some aspects of my website, I decided to include more and better content.
    I decided to write better descriptions and include more information for my work experiences, 
    and I also was more descriptive about each of the CS Projects listed. I also included HW3 as 
    another project example. For my art projects, I included two more photos with descriptions on the 
    art_projects.html page. 

For the third party libraries: 

    Google Analytics: Tracks user and traffic activity

        I included the script tags in the head element of each page in order 
        to better track all activity across my site. 

    Slick:

    Animate on Scroll: 
    link: https://github.com/michalsnik/aos

        I included this script of the bottom of the pages (as per the docs), 
        and utilized it in order to simplify allowing elements and sections to
        fade in upon being visible in the viewport.
